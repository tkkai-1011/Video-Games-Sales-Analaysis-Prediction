2. doing some SQL query or Spark-SQL analysis function on the data
3. transform those data to graph which can be displayed
4. Define input format to test step 2
5. set up linear regression model based on existing dataset
6. test and split dataset
7. using predict function to predict value for given input
8. display result with R squared, P value see if they are within AC
9. apply multi-threading to application to reduce response time within 1s for analysis and 2s for predict
10.apply UI to applciation
11.intergrating all and test all
